# CONTRIBUTING

## CODE STYLE
The Symfony coding standards must be followed at all times.

## PULL REQUESTS
All pull requests must be descriptive and provide a bullet pointed list of what has changed.

If you are fixing multiple bugs or updating multiple standalone features, these should be split into separate branches, and thus separate pull requests.
